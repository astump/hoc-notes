\section{What is a type theory?}

A type theory is a statically typed programming language that can be
understood as a logic.  Programs are viewed as proofs, and the types
of programs are viewed as the formulas they prove.  This famous idea
is called the Curry-Howard isomorphism.  A very simple example is the
program $\lam{x}{\lam{y}{x}}$, which takes in input $x$ and then input
$y$, and returns $x$.  This program can be given the type $A \to B \to
A$, for any types $A$ and $B$.  That type expresses that the program
takes in an input of type $A$ and then one of type $B$, and returns a
result of type $A$.  That indeed correctly describes the behavior of
$\lam{x}{\lam{y}{x}}$.  But it is also a valid logical formula, where
the $\to$ operator is implication: $A$ implies $B$ implies $A$ for the
trivial reason that $A$ implies $A$, and adding an extra assumption
that $B$ is true does not change that fact.  To go beyond just
propositional logic, type theories use more expressive types than just
implications.  We will see examples below.

To be interpreted as a logic, it is not enough to have a way
to view the types of a programming language as formulas.  We must
ensure that it is not possible to prove false formulas.  So the
language must be logically sound.  In type theory, an essential part
of ensuring logical soundness is to guarantee that all programs
terminate.  The reason for this is that an infinite loop can be
viewed, in most programming languages, as having any type one wants.
So you can prove the formula \textsf{False} by writing a diverging
program.

Much theoretical effort has been expended on techniques for proving
logical soundness of type theories, by showing that all programs
are guaranteed to terminate.  Bend has a very interesting original
approach to this problem, which we consider next.

\section{Bend's approach to logical soundness}

There are two current traditions for devising type theories, that
should be mentioned for comparison with Bend's approach:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Church-style} type theory builds up a notion of typed
  terms (programs), where the types are inherent to those terms.  By a
  difficult argument, one shows that all well-typed programs
  terminate.  So the type system is enforcing termination, in addition
  to other properties usually enforced by static typing.  From
  termination, it is then easy to argue that the system is logically
  sound.  This is because it is relatively easy to show that values,
  which are the final results of computation, cannot have type False.

\item \textbf{Curry-style} type theory starts with a notion of
  type-free program, and then adds types to describe properties of the
  behavior of programs.  For example, the identity function can be
  described as having type $X \to X$ for any type $X$, as it is
  guaranteed to take an input of type $X$ and return an output of type
  $X$ (namely, the input it was given).  A difficult argument is still
  required to show that typing enforces termination.  But the language
  design is made quite a bit easier by not having types be inherent
  parts of programs.  This is because in reasoning about programs,
  one does not then have to reason about types inside them.  Programs
  are type-free, and typing comes second.  In fact, the slogan I propose
  for this style of type theory is ``Computation First'' (because we
  first explain what type-free programs are and how they execute, and
  only afterwards use types to describe their properties).  The great
  computer scientist Jean-Louis Krivine puts it simply: ``types can
  be thought of as properties of $\lambda$-terms''~\cite[page 43]{krivine93}.
\end{enumerate}

Bend's philosophy can be viewed as a strengthened form of Curry-style
type theory, with the modified slogan: ``Terminating Computation
First''.  The idea, proposed by Victor Taelin, is similar to
Curry-style type theory, where one first defines type-free programs,
and how they compute.  But differently, these programs are designed so
that they are guaranteed to terminate, without reference to any notion
of typing.  Just the structure of the programs and the rules for how
the execute are sufficient to establish that all programs terminate.
Giving a detailed proof of that fact is still not trivial, but
expected to be much simpler than the approaches based on typing.  And
then one has a lot of freedom to design a type system on top of the
terminating type-free language.  Now the only requirement is that the
language should have the usual type-safety property that ones expects
of any statically typed programming language. This is vastly easier to
achieve than crafting a type system that enforces termination.

As we begin our look at Bend, it is important to emphasize one further
design goal for the language: minimality.  We aim to have a core
language with a small number of primitive operations, and similarly
for the type system.  This is both for ease of implementation, and
reliability of the language design.

\section{Bend's core language}

The syntax of Bend's core programming language is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pl}.  Programs, called terms, can be variables $x$,
machine integers $i$, or infix applications $t\ o\ t'$ of arithmetic
operators $o$ to arguments $t$ and $t'$.  They can also be anonymous
functions $\lam{x}{s}$, with the restriction that $x$ may be used at
most once in $s$.  Some restriction is needed, or else it is very easy
to write diverging $\lambda$-terms.  Traditionally, type theories have
restricted anonymous functions using types.  With Bend's approach to
logical consistency, we need a type-free way to enforce termination of
$\lambda$-terms.  One method is to restrict how often a variable may
be used in an anonymous function.  Bend requires $\lambda$-bound
variables to be used at most once.  Such $\lambda$-abstractions are
called affine.  It is well known that this restriction ensures
termination.  It does impose serious limits on programs written with
anonymous functions, but we will see that the way recursion works
expands the possibilities greatly (while preserving termination).

Returning to the syntax: we have applications $t\ t'$ of a term $t$
being used as a function to term $t'$ given as the argument to that
function.  We have a trivial piece of data $\wunit$, which is useful as
a placehold.  We could use a machine integer $i$ as a base case
instead, but we will see that with typing, it is more convenient to
have a separate trivial piece of data.  That is $\wunit$.  We have a
way to form structured data $\ctor{l}{n}{r}$, and a term $\wrec{r}{t}$
for recursing over such data.  These constructs constitute a version of
what is known as W-types, and they will be presented in detail below.

\begin{figure}
  \[
  \begin{array}{llll}
    \textit{Variables}  & x,y,z,\ldots & \ &\ \\
    \textit{Machine integers}  & i,j,\ldots & ::= & 0\ |\ 1\ | \ \cdots \\
    \textit{Arithmetic operators} & o & ::= & +\ |\ *\ |\ \cdots \\        
    \textit{Terms} & s,r,t & ::= & x\ |\ i\ |\ t\ o\ t'\ |\ \lam{x}{s}\ |\ t\ t'\ |\ \wunit\ |\ \ctor{l}{n}{r}\ |\ \wrec{r}{t}
  \end{array}
\]
\caption{The syntax for Bend's programming language.  In $\lambda$-abstractions, the variable $x$ is allowed
  to occur at most once in the body $s$}
\label{fig:pl}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Structured data}

To implement data structures, every programming language needs some
approach to creating and processing structured data.  In Bend, the
main form of structured data is the construction $\ctor{l}{n}{r}$.
Before we discuss this, though, it is very helpful to have a way of
constructing pairs $(t,t')$.

\subsubsection{Pairs}

There are several possibilities for how to include pairs in Bend.
Here we propose to $\lambda$-encode them.  So we take this definition:
\[
(t,t') := \lam{c}{c\ t\ t'}
\]
\noindent Syntactically, we propose to add pairs as primitive syntax,
but the implementation of Bend will just treat them as defined.  There
are two benefits to defining pairs this way.  First, we do not need to
add another primitive construction for pairs to the semantics of the
language: they are just defined using a $\lambda$-term.  Second, we
gain affine access to the components of a pair: we can make use of a
pair just once and still obtain both its components.  If instead we
had primitive accessors like $p.1$ and $p.2$ for accessing the
components of a pair $p$, we would not be able to write simple
functions like the one that swaps the components of a pair, as an
affine function.  For such a function would be written as
\[
\lam{p}{(p.2,p.1)}
\]
\noindent where we can see that the $\lambda$-bound input variable is used twice.
Instead, we define swapping of pair $p$ as
\[
p\ \lam{x}{\lam{y}{(y,x)}}
\]
\noindent This looks a little peculiar, but recall that pairs are defined to be functions.
So if $p$ is $(1,2)$, for example, then we will have this computational behavior:
\[
(1,2)\ \lam{x}{\lam{y}{(y,x)}} \ =\ (\lam{c}{c\ 1\ 2})\ \lam{x}{\lam{y}{(y,x)}}\ \leadsto\ (\lam{x}{\lam{y}{(y,x)}})\ 1\ 2 \leadsto^* (2,1)
\]
\noindent The input variable $c$ gets instantiated with
$\lam{x}{\lam{y}{(y,x)}}$, giving that $\lambda$-term access to both
components of the pair.  These $\lambda$-abstractions are all linear:
the input variables $c$, $x$, and $y$ are used exactly once in the
terms where they are $\lambda$-bound.

\subsubsection{Structures}

The construction $\ctor{l}{n}{f}$ will be called a W-structure (or just structure, for short).
It is the basic form in Bend for recursively structured data.  The idea for structures
comes from the type-theoretic construction known as W-types.  Indeed, Bend's structures
are just a version of those for W-types.  Since Bend starts from a type-free programming
language and then adds types, we start with W-structures, and define the W-types that
describe them later.  We also have a primitive feature $\wrec{r}{t}$ of the language,
for recursively processing a structure.

A structure $\ctor{l}{n}{f}$ consists of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \emph{label} $l$, to describe what kind of structure this is
\item nonrecursive subdata $n$, which will not be recursively processed
  by recursions $\wrec{r}{t}$
\item a recursive subdata function $f$, which takes in an index $x$
  that specifies which piece of recursive subdata is desired, and
  returns it.
  \end{itemize}

\noindent The index $x$ given to the subdata function $f$ is drawn
from some finite set if the structure has only finitely many immediate
subdata.  For example, a list node has one piece of subdata, namely
the tail, while a node of a binary tree has two pieces of subdata.  So
the indices would come from a one-element set and a two-element set,
respectively.  But the power of W-structures comes from the fact that
$i$ could also be from an infinite set, in which case the structure
can have infinitely many immediate subdata.  There is still a
restriction, though.  While there may be infinitely many paths through
a structure, each path is finite.  This enables us to define
$\wrec{r}{t}$ as a form of terminating recursion over structures,
because we cannot recurse infinitely deeply into a structure.

For recursions $\wrec{r}{t}$ over a structure $t$, we write a function
$r$ which takes the structure's label, nonrecursive subdata, and
subdata function.  $r$ also is provided a function $q$ that returns
recursive results.  Then $r$  returns a result, generally by calling
$q$.  For each possible input to $f$, the function $q$ returns the
result of recursing on the subdata $f\ i$; that is, the $i$'th piece
of subdata.  The recursor $\wrec{r}{t}$ uses this function $r$ to
recursively process a structure $t$. The reduction rule, which
explains how recursions work computationally, is:

\[
\wrec{r}{\ctor{l}{n}{f}} \leadsto r\ l\ n\ f\ (\lam{x}{\wrec{r}{(f\ x)}})
\]

\noindent So someone using the recursor writes $r$, and then for each
piece of data $\ctor{l}{n}{f}$, that function $r$ will be invoked with
the label $l$, the nonrecursive subdata $n$, and the function $f$,
which $r$ can then call as needed to obtain subdata.  The fourth
argument to $r$ is the value that $r$ will use for $q$, namely
$\lam{x}{\wrec{R}{(f\ x)}}$.  That function takes in an index $x$, and
recursively invokes the recursor on the $x$'th piece of subdata, given
by $f\ x$.  


\subsection{Reduction semantics}

Figure~\ref{fig:opsem} gives the complete reduction semantics for
Bend.  This semantics specifies the meaning of programs by saying how
they compute.  Calling it a ``reduction'' semantics indicates that we
are not specifying a deterministic evaluation order for programs.
There might be multiple choices of which part of a term to reduce
next, and the rules does not specify which one should be chosen.  So
the reduction relation is nondeterministic.  But we will show below
(Section~\ref{sec:opmeta}) that all choices are guaranteed to lead to
the same result.  It could happen that some choices lead to that
result more efficiently.  But they all will, in principle, succeed.

Returning to Figure~\ref{fig:opsem}: there are reduction rules for
reducing terms where an anonymous function $\lam{x}{s}$ is applied to
an argument $t$.  This is the well-known $\beta$-rule from lambda
calculus.  It uses the notation $[t/x]s$ to denote the result of
substituting $t$ for $x$ in $s$.  This should be done in a standard
way to avoid capturing free variables of $t$ as one passes under
$\lambda$-abstractions in $s$.  There is also the reduction rule for
W-structures, mentioned above.  The two rule inference rules
at the bottom of the figure then define multi-step reduction $\leadsto^*$
in terms of single-step reduction $\leadsto$.  The first rule says
that if you can single-step reduce $s$ to $t$, then you can do a multi-step
reduction of a term containing $s$ some finite number of times to one
containing instead $t$.  The term $r$ mentioned in the rule might
not contain $x$ at all, in which case we get reflexivity of $\leadsto^*$,
as the rule will say that $r \leadsto^* r$ in that situation.

The semantics as presented here does not specify the exact behavior of the machine operations
on integers.  Those can be specified in detail later as needed.  It is noteworthy that the
semantics is quite compact, in terms of numbers of rules needed to define it.  This is
in keeping with Bend's goal of minimality.

\begin{figure}
  \[
\begin{array}{l}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    (\lam{x}{s})\ t & \leadsto & [t/x]s \\
    \wrec{R}{\ctor{l}{n}{f}} & \leadsto & R\ l\ n\ f\ (\lam{x}{\wrec{R}{(f\ x)}}) \\
    i\ o\ i' & \leadsto & j\ \ \textnormal{according to machine semantics for }o
  \end{array}
  \\ \\
  \begin{array}{lll}
  \infer{[s/x]r \leadsto^* [t/x]r}{s \leadsto t} &\ \ &
  \infer{r \leadsto^* t}{r \leadsto^* s & s \leadsto^* t}
  \end{array}
\end{array}  
\]

  \end{figure}

\section{Typing}

Having proposed a syntax and reduction semantics for Bend, let us now
consider typing.  We can describe Bend's proposed type system very
succinctly: it is the (Curry-style) Calculus of Constructions plus a
simple variant of W-types, and including also a primitive typed
extensional equality type.  In this section, we will elaborate on
this short description, one ingredient at a time.

One overarching point: the type system is Curry-style, meaning that
typing rules should be viewed as defining a typing relation on the
untyped terms whose syntax is given above in Figure~\ref{fig:pl}.  But
in this section, we will present the rules using annotated terms,
which contain enough information to confirm a typing for a term.  An
example is the annotated term $\tlam{x}{A}{t}$, with a type for the
bound variable.  So the typing rules look like Church-style rules,
computing types for terms that have various type annotations in them.
But there is a critical difference.  With Curry-style typing, we are
entitled to make use of an erasure function $|e|$ to drop all
annotations from the term parts of expressions $e$.  This function is
used in the conversion rule, allowing us to change the type $A$ of a
term to a type $B$, if $|A|$ and $|B|$ are convertible.  Using erasure
at conversion allows us to equate many more terms than with
Church-style typing, and eliminates many difficult technical problems
reasoning about annotated terms, which are encountered in Church-style
type theory.

  \textit{Ty} & \ni & R,S,T & ::= &
     X \ | \ \Pia{x}{T}{T'}\ |\ \Pia{X}{\kappa}{T}\ |\ \tlam{x}{T}{T'} \ |\ \tlam{X}{\kappa}{T}\ |\ T\ t\ |\ T\ T' \\\\
  \textit{Tm} & \ni & r,s,t & ::= & x \ |\ \tlam{x}{T}{t}\ | \ \tlam{X}{\kappa}{t}\ |\ t\ t'\ |\ t\ T \ 
\end{array}
\]
\caption{Syntax of CC}
\label{fig:ccsyn}
\end{figure}

The syntax for the Curry-style Calculus of Constructions (CC) is
listed in Figure~\ref{fig:ccsyn}.  The three main syntactic categories
defined there are annotated terms (\textit{Tm}), types (\textit{Ty},
and kinds (\textit{Knd}).  Types abstract terms, and kinds abstract
types.  For example, every natural number is a term, abstracted by the
type \textit{Nat}.  And every type (like \textit{Nat}) is abstracted
by kind $\star$.  The typing rules are given in Figure~\ref{fig:tc}.  Erasure (used in
the \textsc{conv} rules) is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:erase}.  Erasure
leaves the structure of types and kinds unchanged, but drops typing
annotations from terms.

\subsection{An extensional equality type}

We extend the syntax defined in Figure~\ref{fig:ccsyn} with the following additions:
\[
\begin{array}{lllll}
  \textit{Ty} & \ni & R,S,T & ::= & \cdots\ |\ \eqtm{t}{T}{t'} \\
  \textit{Tm} & \ni & r,s,t & ::= & \cdots\ |\ \rewrt{s}{t}\ |\ \cng{x}{T}{t}\ |\ \ext{t}
\end{array}
\]
\noindent The erasure function is extended to the new forms of term as follows:
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
  |\rewrt{s}{t}| & = & |t| \\
  |\cng{x}{T}{t}| & = & |t| \\
  |\ext{t}| & = & |t| 
\end{array}
\]
\noindent The typing and kinding rules for these new constructs are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:eqtp}.
